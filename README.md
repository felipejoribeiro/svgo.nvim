Illustrate.nvim is a lua plugin for neovim that lets you quickly create, search and open **SVG** files in Inkscape (Linux, macOS) from within neovim. It works with Markdown files.

## Features

With key bindings you define, `illustrate` can:

- Create a new `.svg` file with a name of your choice, insert a code snippet of the figure automatically, and open the figure in Inkscape. The example key binding provided below is
  `<leader>i`.
- Open the figure under the cursor, in Inkscape. The example key binding below is `<leader>io`.

The plugin currently supports macOS and Linux only.

## Installation

The plugin is currently designed for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

### lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
  'felipejoribeiro/svgo.nvim',
  dependencies = {
    "rcarriga/nvim-notify",
  },
  keys = function()
    local illustrate = require('svgo')
    return {
      {
        "<leader>i",
        function() illustrate.create_and_open_svg() end,
        desc = "Create and open a new SVG file with provided name."
      },
      {
        "<leader>io",
        function() illustrate.open_under_cursor() end,
        desc = "Open file under cursor (or file within environment under cursor)."
      },
    }
  end,
  opts = {},
}
```
